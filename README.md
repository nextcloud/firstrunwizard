# WECHANGE First run wizard

This is a slightly modified version of nextcloud's first run wizard with changes needed for the integration in the Cosinnus cloud

## Development setup (taken from nextcloud's README)

1. ☁ Clone the app into the `apps` folder of your Nextcloud: `git clone https://github.com/wechange-eg/nextcloud-firstrunwizard.git`
2. 👩‍💻 Run `make dev-setup` to install the dependencies
3. 🏗 To build the Javascript after you have made changes, run `make build-js`
4. ✅ Enable the app through the app management of your Nextcloud
5. 🎉 Partytime! Help fix [some issues](https://github.com/nextcloud/firstrunwizard/issues) and [review pull requests](https://github.com/nextcloud/firstrunwizard/pulls) 👍
